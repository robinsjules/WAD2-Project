Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice.","ingredients":[{"id":93632,"name":"clarified butter","localizedName":"clarified butter","image":"ghee.jpg"},{"id":1012013,"name":"coriander","localizedName":"coriander","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":18023,"name":"cornbread","localizedName":"cornbread","image":"cornbread.jpg"},{"id":99217,"name":"paratha","localizedName":"paratha","image":"pita-bread.jpg"},{"id":14209,"name":"coffee","localizedName":"coffee","image":"brewed-coffee.jpg"},{"id":18064,"name":"bread","localizedName":"bread","image":"white-bread.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","localizedName":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":93632,"name":"ghee","localizedName":"ghee","image":"ghee.jpg"},{"id":20444,"name":"rice","localizedName":"rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]}]}],"spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/lamb-chops-masala-649199"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"lowFodmap":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":15,"gaps":"no","preparationMinutes":-1,"cookingMinutes":-1,"aggregateLikes":1,"healthScore":46,"creditsText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","pricePerServing":374.84,"id":637391,"title":"Chai Pani’s Malabar Chicken Curry","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":4,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/SZ8F8FWX/chai-panis-malabar-chicken-curry","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/637391-312x231.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"If you want to add more <b>gluten free, dairy free, and whole 30</b> recipes to your repertoire, Chai Pani’s Malabar Chicken Curry might be a recipe you should try.
