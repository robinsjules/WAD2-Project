# Introduction to SurplusHero
SurplusHero is a web application that aims to address the issue of food waste. In Singapore, nearly three-quarters of a million tonnes of food is wasted every year. Households account for 44% of this total food waste, while food retailers, restaurants, and other food service businesses make up the remaining 56%.

## Sustainable Development Goals
In line with the United Nation's SDGs, our group is committed to this mission of a sustainable future.

- <b>SDG 2: Zero Hunger:</b> By reducing the amount of food wasted at both the consumer and producer level, there is less need to produce more and more food, and it can be distributed more efficiently. Since food waste increases the need for higher yields and larger farms, reducing it can save valuable resources.
- <b>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production:</b> Singapore imports over 90% of our food supply and yet food waste is one of our biggest waste streams. By using whatever food that is left in one's fridge as well as purchasing surplus food from grocers that are still edible aligns with responsible consumption.
- <b>SDG 13: Climate Action:</b> Wasting food also wastes all the energy taken to grow, water and cultivate it, as well as the resources spent to harvest, package, and transport them. Avoiding food waste can lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production, processing, transport, and disposal, which accounts for 8% of global emissions.
